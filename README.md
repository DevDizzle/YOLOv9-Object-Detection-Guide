# YOLOv9 Fine-Tuning Guide for Object Detection

This repository provides a structured approach to fine-tuning the YOLOv9 model for custom object detection tasks. The included notebook and modular project structure aim to simplify the process for both beginners and advanced users.

---

## Features

- **Step-by-Step Notebook**: A complete guide to fine-tuning YOLOv9 using pre-trained weights and a custom dataset.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Tools to combine and process training and validation datasets dynamically.
- **Training and Validation**: Scripts and configurations to train and validate your YOLOv9 model effectively.
- **Inference**: Run inference on test images to evaluate the model’s performance visually.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Example `data.yaml` and model architecture files to get started quickly.
